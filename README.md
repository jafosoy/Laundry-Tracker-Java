# The Ultimate Laundry Tracker
## (to make sure your clothing doesn't smell)

## Project Proposal

- The application is useful to **keep track of the amount of times clothing has been worn**, and will help by **setting 
reminders to do laundry**. This application will be able to *track the frequency* of when clothing has been worn, 
with the user *inputting when they wear* a piece of clothing, and the application *setting an alert* when a piece of 
clothing should be put in the laundry basket. This application will also be able to *alert the user* when the closet is 
low in clothing, and allows the user to *set and organize* what is being put in the laundry. 
- From a parent completing tasks around the house, to a college student having to do their own laundry, this application 
is useful for just about anyone. With this, you would be able to keep track of when you should be doing the laundry, and
organize what you want to wash each time. While this application is meant to keep track of when clothing should be 
washed, it also allows users to keep track of how often the same clothing has been worn, and when they should think up 
a different outfit. 
- As a college student, I am often too busy to keep track of how often I wear the same pair of jeans, or when I am 
running low on socks and underwear. I'm sure I am not the only student who has this problem, and this is likely worse 
for people with a larger set of clothing (e.g. a big family?), or with similar looking clothing 
(i.e. the same uniforms to a job). Thus, I think that this application will help anyone with **closet organization** and 
**ensuring proper hygiene**. 

## User Stories

the frequency I can use it

the number of times the clothing has been worn, and the frequency I had set earlier (limit frequency <= times worn)
